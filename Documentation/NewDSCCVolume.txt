    -snap_warn_level <Int32>
        Threshold for available space as a percentage of volume size below which an alert is raised. Defaults to the default 
        snapshot warning level set on the group, typically 0. 
        This parameter is only valid for device-type2 which represents Alletra 6K and Nimble Storage.

    -warn_level <Int32>
        Threshold for available space as a percentage of volume size below which an alert is raised. If this option is not specified, 
        array default volume warn level setting is used to decide the warning level for this volume. Percentage as integer from 0 to 100. 
        Defaults to the default volume warning level set on the group, typically 80.
        This parameter is only valid for device-type2 which represents Alletra 6K and Nimble Storage.

    -WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]
        The WhatIf directive will show you the RAW RestAPI call that would be made to DSCC instead of actually sending the request.
        This option is very helpful when trying to understand the inner workings of the native RestAPI calls that DSCC uses.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False

        Accept wildcard characters?  false
