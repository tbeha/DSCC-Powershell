SYNOPSIS
    Removes a Volume from a DSCC Storage System.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-DSCCVolume [-SystemId] <String> [-VolumeId] <String> [-Cascade] [-unExport] [-force] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The command will remove a specific volume from a Storage System, but to run this command you will need to know the VolumeID 
    and the StorageSystemID. This command includes parameters to both force the delete, as well as force a cascading delete that removes linked items.
    

PARAMETERS
    -SystemId <String>
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    1
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       true (ByPropertyName)
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -VolumeId <String>
        A single Storage System Volume ID is specified and required.
        
        Required?                    true
        Position?                    2
        Default value                
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -Cascade [<SwitchParameter>]
        This option is only valid for devices that are of type Device-Type1 (Alletra9K, Primera, 3PAR) and will be ignored on Device-Type2 devices 
        (Alletra6K and Nimble Storage). This option will remove both the Volume and the dependant snapshots all in a single command.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -unExport [<SwitchParameter>]
        This option is only valid for devices that are of type Device-Type1 (Alletra9K, Primera, 3PAR) and will be ignored on Device-Type2 devices 
        (Alletra6K and Nimble Storage). This option will remove both the volume as well as unexport the host and host-sets that this volume is mapped 
        to.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -force [<SwitchParameter>]
        The option will force the volume offline and remove it on a Device-type2 (Alletra 6K or Nimble Storage) type system. The default behaviour
        without the force option being set to true is to only delete a volume that is already offline. If used with a Device-Type2 (Alletra9K, 
        Primera, 3PAR) 
        this field will be ignored.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
        
    -WhatIf [<SwitchParameter>]
        The WhatIf directive will show you the RAW RestAPI call that would be made to DSCC instead of actually sending the request.
        This option is very helpful when trying to understand the inner workings of the native RestAPI calls that DSCC uses.
        
        Required?                    false
        Position?                    named
        Default value                False
        Accept pipeline input?       false
        Accept wildcard characters?  false
