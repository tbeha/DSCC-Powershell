NAME
    Remove-DSCCInitiator
    
SYNOPSIS
    Removes a HPE DSSC Initiator.
    
    
SYNTAX
    Remove-DSCCInitiator [-InitiatorId] <String> [-Force] [[-WhatIf] <Boolean>] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Removes a HPE Data Services Cloud Console Host specified by Initiator ID; If the 
    initiator is a Device-Type2, then it will read the initiator to determine which system to delete the initiator from, 
    otherwise it will send the command to the DSCC console, which works for initiators not assigned to individual storage
    systems, or those assigned to Device-Type1
    

PARAMETERS
    -InitiatorId <String>
        A single Initiator ID must be specified.
        
    -Force [<SwitchParameter>]
        Will implement an API forcefull remove option instead of the default normal removal mechanism.
        
    -WhatIf <Boolean>
        The WhatIf directive will show you the RAW RestAPI call that would be made to DSCC instead of actually sending the request.
        This option is very helpful when trying to understand the inner workings of the native RestAPI calls that DSCC uses.
