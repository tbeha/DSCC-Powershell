HPE Data Storage Cloud Console (DSCC) Powershell scripts used in customer projects.

The HPE DSCC API powershell scripts are based on the HPE Data Storage Cloud Console Powershell Toolkit (https://github.com/HewlettPackard/HPEDSCC-PowerShell-Toolkit), but during the development of the customized scripts I have found some bugs in the Powershell Toolkit, that I reported back to the HPE DSCC Powershell Toolkit developper. Nevertheless, since I didn't have time to wait for the toolkit updates, I have adjusted my current download of the toolkit to fix the bugs. As a result, if you want to run these scripts you need to download and use the complete package available here. 

The documenation on the HPE DSCC RestAPI can be found at https://console-us1.data.cloud.hpe.com/doc/api/v1/

As much as I have tested and used the scripts in customer environments, I can not guarantee that the scripts are running in every environment without issues. Use the scripts at your own risk.
